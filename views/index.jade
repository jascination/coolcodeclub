      p Code Club Cool is a once-weekly chance to learn to build websites.
      p It's aimed at Melbourne's young creatives, with the goal of making coding accessible and approachable.
      p Classes are free-form in style; sometimes we'll do self-paced tutorials, sometimes we'll do structured classes, sometimes we'll drink beers and talk about which pokemon was best (Psyduck).

        p Thanks! I think you're cool too. 
        p Building websites is (a) really fun and satisfying, (b) personally empowering and (c) a lucrative career/side-job, and I'd like to share that skill with people.
        p If you have a friend who you want to bring along, please do - the more the merrier.
        p (but we'll cap the classes at 30 people)

          | , and instructors will all be volunteers.
        p In the future, we'll aim at launching a skill-sharing programme where you'll teach these skills to recent migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and under-privileged children. 
        p But let's focus on teaching you the basics first.
