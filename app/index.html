        <p>Web development is a skillset built entirely on sharing.</p>
        <p>Nearly everyone who builds websites learned using tools made by incredibly generous people who wanted to share their craft with the world.</p>
        <p>Cool Code Club is a weekly meetup for learning web development, creating cool things and good old fashioned nerding out.</p>
        <p>It's completely free. But there's a twist.</p>
        <h1>!!!</h1>
        <p>Shh, it's a good twist. Each week we'll ask for a donation, put towards buying laptops for underprivileged children, asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
        <p>We'll also ask you to consider passing on your new-found skills to these people. It's easier than you think.</p>
        <h1>Who!</h1>
        <p>You! Plus James' cool mates and mates of James' cool mates! </p>
